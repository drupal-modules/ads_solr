# Version: $Id$

# Synonym file format
# Explicit mappings match any token sequence on the LHS of "=>"
# and replace with all alternatives on the RHS.  These types of mappings
# ignore the expand parameter in the schema.
# Examples:
#  i-pod, i pod => ipod,
#  sea biscuit, sea biscit => seabiscuit
#
# Equivalent synonyms may be separated with commas and give
# no explicit mapping.  In this case the mapping behavior will
# be taken from the expand parameter in the schema.  This allows
# the same synonym file to be used in different synonym handling strategies.
# Examples:
#  ipod, i-pod, i pod
#  foozball , foosball
#  universe , cosmos
#
# If expand==true, "ipod, i-pod, i pod" is equivalent to the explicit mapping:
#  ipod, i-pod, i pod => ipod, i-pod, i pod
# If expand==false, "ipod, i-pod, i pod" is equivalent to the explicit mapping:
#  ipod, i-pod, i pod => ipod
#
# multiple synonym mapping entries are merged.
#  foo => foo bar
#  foo => baz
# is equivalent to
#  foo => foo bar, baz
#
# Note: blank lines and lines starting with pound are comments.
